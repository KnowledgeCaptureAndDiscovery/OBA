In this test, we evaluate three ways to obtain 100 resources from a endpoint,

Methods:

1. Using API generated by OBA (python) using pagination.
2. Using API generated by OBA (python) using pagination and Reverse Proxy with caching enabled (NGINX).
3. Sending the SPARQL query to endpoint.


### Summary

!!! TLDR
    We recommend to use Reverse Proxy with Caching cache in production.

If you use a Reverse Proxy with Caching, you can use OBA to production environment. We recommend to use NGINX and follow the guide [NGINX Content Caching](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/content-cache/content-caching/)

The following figures show the latency by percentile distribution in a test scenario, the client sent 60 requests per second over 60 seconds.

![Diagram](figures/api_cached.png)
**Figure 1**: 60 requests per second using Reverse Proxy with Caching

![Diagram](figures/endpoint.png)
**Figure 2**: 60 requests per second to the endpoint

We concluded the latencies are similar in the 99.9% of the requests.
